 * BCON-08 and NFR-SC03, and RISK_REGISTER R32.
 *
 * Redis is deployed as a cluster, where `DEL k1 k2` is refused with `CROSSSLOT Keys in request don't hash
 * to the same slot` unless every key lands in the same slot — and nothing here arranges that, because the
 * session and rate-limit keys are digests of tokens. One key per call is therefore not a style
 * preference: the batched form is what every non-cluster Redis codebase writes out of habit,
 * `@redis/client` types it as legal (`del(keys: RedisArgument | Array<RedisArgument>)`), TypeScript is
 * happy, and it fails at runtime on the path that revokes a session. Until this block existed the
 * convention was prose in three documents and machine-checked nowhere.
 *
 * Three selectors, because the batch arrives three ways — `del(a, b)`, `del([a, b])`, `del(...keys)` —
 * and a rule carrying one of them passes the other two. Keyed on the method name alone rather than on
 * `redisClient`, because the client is injected here: the shared session helpers call `store.del(...)`
 * through `ISessionWriteStore`, and a selector naming the client would see none of them. What that width
 * costs is that any `.del()` or `.unlink()` on an unrelated object is held to the same shape — including
 * the callback form of `fs.unlink`, which nothing on this platform uses. A call that genuinely needs two
 * arguments is a decision worth a reviewer, which is what failing here buys.
 *
 * ⚠️ **An identifier holding a pre-built array is invisible to all three.** `const keys = [a, b]` then
 * `store.del(keys)` is a syntax tree this rule cannot distinguish from the single-key call, so the block
 * narrows the ways in rather than closing them — RISK_REGISTER R32 stays open at its measured level for
 * that reason.

 * ADR-012, and the one thing holding the two-level category cap up.
 *
 * The cap is enforced in a resolver — `throwIfParentNotTopLevel`, in
 * `marketplace-dev-admin-authenticated-resource` — and not in the collection's `$jsonSchema`, because a
 * validator cannot read a second document to find out how deep the one in front of it sits. That is a
 * MongoDB limit rather than a design preference, and ADR-012 accepts it. What it costs is that the cap
 * holds exactly as long as every write to `itemCategory` goes through the four functions that call the
 * check. A write added on any other tier is a third level with nothing to refuse it, and nothing
 * structural noticed. RISK_REGISTER R19.
 *
 * Two selectors for the call rather than one: `ItemCategory.updateOne(...)` and
 * `ItemCategory['updateOne'](...)` are the same write, and a `property.name` rule passes the second — the
 * same `key.name` / `key.value` split the TLS selectors above already carry. A third for the import,
 * because both call selectors are keyed on the identifier and an alias would rename the model out of
 * their reach.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A write ban, not a ban.** The read verbs are absent on purpose: `throwIfItemCategoryMissing`
 * counts, the catalogue resolvers query, and a rule refusing those would refuse the tier's own work.
