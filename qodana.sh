# Redis cluster AND the REAL MongoDB (REDIS_* / MONGODB_URI from .env). If either is

# Qodana's IntelliJ JS language service runs as `node --max_old_space_size=1024` inside the scan
# container and aborts (SIGABRT) when it hits that hardcoded 1 GB cap. Where the kernel writes the
# dump is decided by the *host's* /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern: a bare relative pattern like "core"
# (plus core_uses_pid=1 -> "core.<pid>") puts it in the crashing process's cwd, which is the
# bind-mounted project root. On this workstation that reached 12 files and 15.2 GB in
# marketplace-common before anyone noticed, and `prettier --check` then died on them with "Invalid
# string length" — prettier reads a file before deciding it cannot format it.
#
# The host has since been given an absolute core_pattern, which is the real fix, but it is one
# machine-wide setting that no repo controls: a reboot without a persisted sysctl, another
# workstation, or CI brings the exposure straight back. `ulimit -c 0` here would not help either —
# the container inherits RLIMIT_CORE from the docker *daemon*, not from this client shell. So sweep
# after the scan, which is the part this repo does control.

# Only `core.<digits>` and a bare `core` that really is an ELF core dump are removed, so a future
