 * is the LAST statement of each path, so stubbing it lets the real work in front of it run against
 * the real Redis cluster and the real MongoDB and simply return instead of killing the runner.
 *

 * and `disconnectAllDatabases` really tears down both live connections — which is exactly why this
 * file lives on its own: vitest isolates each test file in its own module registry, so the
