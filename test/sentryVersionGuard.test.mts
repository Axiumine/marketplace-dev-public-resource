/*
 * E12-S05 — the guard that fires when the Sentry SDK moves under this configuration.
 *
 * Everything `src/instrument.mts` asserts about the SDK was read out of `node_modules` at 10.69.0:
 * that supplying `dataCollection` at all swaps the base for the fully permissive `DEFAULTS`, that `[]`
 * is the documented "collect no bodies" value, that `graphQL.variables` is on in both branches of the
 * legacy mapping, and that the client address is written onto the server span outside the whole
 * mechanism. None of that is a documented API contract, and the blanket PII flag the mapping starts
 * from is deprecated and removed in v11. A guard written against a moving SDK stops guarding the day
 * the dependency bumps, silently — which is the failure this test exists to make loud.
 *
 * It pins the exact version rather than the major, because one of those claims is a *minor*-version
 * detail. `SENSITIVE_KEY_SNIPPETS` is what makes an `authorization` header arrive `[Filtered]` today,
 * it lives in `@sentry/core/build/esm/utils/data-collection/filtering-snippets.js`, it is exported from
 * no public entry point, and a minor release may add to it, drop from it or move the file without
 * anything here failing. The platform must never be reduced on the strength of that list, and the
 * second case below is what proves it is not: the scrubber removes the header on its own, with no SDK
 * involved at all.
