/**
 * Provision this service's throwaway database before the integration project runs.
 *
 * Two users, the same split production uses:
 *   - the DB OWNER connects here, drops the database and replays every marketplace-db-setup migration,
 *     so the collections the suite writes to carry the real `$jsonSchema` validators and the real
 *     indexes — a seed that violates one is rejected by the server, not by a hand-written copy;
 *   - the R/W user is the one the service under test connects with (see vitest.config.mts).
 *
 * The migrations are read from the sibling repo rather than duplicated. They are immutable and
 * self-contained by design, so replaying the files directly is equivalent to `migrate:up`; the
 * `changelog` bookkeeping is migrate-mongo's and is not needed for a database that is dropped
 * on every run.
