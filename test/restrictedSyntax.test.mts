 * The `no-restricted-syntax` block in `eslint.config.js`, proved one selector at a time.
 *
 * A rule nobody exercises is a comment. Each fixture below is the *exact* shape the rule exists to
 * refuse — including the assignment form the audit actually found, which a `Property`-only selector
 * would have let through — and the last one is the compliant shape, which must stay silent.
 *
 * The fixtures are `.mts.fixture` rather than `.mts` on purpose: a real `.mts` under `test/` would be
 * linted by `yarn lint` and report the very findings it is here to contain, and adding it to `ignores`
 * would then hide it from this suite too. They are read as text and linted through `lintText` at a
 * `test/`-shaped path, which is the config this block applies to along with every other file.

 * have to be true at once: it fires inside `test/integration/**`, it stays out of the way of the unit

 * seed the harnesses already use. A rule proved only in the first direction is a rule that could be
 * scoped to every file on the platform and still look correct from here.
 *
 * Both paths are invented names rather than real files, which is safe for this rule and not for every
 * one: `no-restricted-imports` reads the import declaration alone, so no TypeScript program has to
