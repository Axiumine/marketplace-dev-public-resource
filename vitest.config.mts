// graphql throws "Duplicate graphql modules / from another realm" when a transformed copy
// (inlined by vitest) and a native copy (externalized in node_modules) meet — which happens
// the moment the real ApolloServer validates the schema. Inlining the whole graphql/Apollo
// chain keeps a single transformed instance across index.mts and Apollo. dedupe pins the path.
// @axiumine/koa-utils is inlined too: it builds GraphQL fields (the reset-password flow) that
// end up in the same schema, so it must see the same graphql instance.
// koa-utils and marketplace-common must stay on the SAME side of this boundary. Both throw
// GraphQLErrors that koa-utils' tryCatchRethrow narrows with `instanceof`; split across the
// boundary they carry different graphql copies, the instanceof is false, and a 401 answers as
// 500 "Internal Server Error" — a failure that exists only under vitest, since plain node
// resolves both to one copy.

//                  ACL-allowed namespace and PORT=0 is ephemeral.
