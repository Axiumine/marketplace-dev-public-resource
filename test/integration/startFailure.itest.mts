 * start()'s catch arm — the boot-failure path — driven for real.
 *
 * No fault is simulated: the datasource URL is pointed at something MongoDB genuinely refuses, and
 * the real driver raises the real error. Redis still connects for real on the same Promise.all,
 * which is the point of doing it this way: the catch has to tear down a HALF-CONNECTED process,
 * and disconnectAllDatabases really closes that live Redis client on the way out.
 *
 * Its own file because it must run with nothing connected yet — index.itest.mts boots the service
 * in its beforeAll, and vitest gives each test file its own module registry, so this one starts
 * from a clean slate.
