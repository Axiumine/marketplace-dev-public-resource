# marketplace-dev-public-resource

Backend svc 1 of 9. Public tier, resource concern. Port 4027.

**Read parent first** — `/media/nvme/websites/fullstack-marketplace-blueprint/CLAUDE.md`. Tier/concern
split, port table, terminology, auth model live there. Not here.

| Need | File |
|---|---|
| hook internals, gate order, node selection | `REPO.md` |
| anything cross-repo | parent `CLAUDE.md` |

## Rules

- **Never commit on `main`.** Branch first: `git switch -c <type>/<slug>`. Merge = user decision alone.
- Merged → delete branch: `git branch -d <slug>`. `-d` only. `-D` never.
- **No remote.** Push-on-request: no `git push` unless the user asked for it in that message.
- **Never lower a coverage or mutation threshold, and never remove a gate.** Threshold miss → write the
  missing test. Bypasses (`SKIP_QODANA=1`, `--no-verify`) are gate removals: use only when the user says so.
- Tabs, not spaces. eslint + prettier both enforce.
- English only — identifiers, comments, fixtures. No exception.
- Domain query/mutation → **resource** svc. Token lifecycle → **authorization** svc.

## Gates

commit → secret guard, lint, coverage, Qodana. push → same + mutation. All blocking. Why: `REPO.md`.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **marketplace-dev-public-resource**. Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/marketplace-dev-public-resource/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/marketplace-dev-public-resource/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/marketplace-dev-public-resource/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/marketplace-dev-public-resource/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Cross-Repo Groups

This repository is listed under GitNexus **group(s): marketplace-platform** (see `~/.gitnexus/groups/`). For cross-repo analysis, use MCP tools `impact`, `query`, and `context` with `repo` set to `@<groupName>` or `@<groupName>/<memberPath>` (paths match keys in that group’s `group.yaml`). Use `group_list` / `group_sync` for membership and sync. From the project root: `node .gitnexus/run.cjs group list`, `node .gitnexus/run.cjs group sync <name>`, `node .gitnexus/run.cjs group impact <name> --target <symbol> --repo <group-path>` (the `.gitnexus/run.cjs` path is repo-root-relative).
